Project #2: Visual Odometry

This final version is located in exec/icp_test.cpp.

To obtain an initial estimate of (a subset of) the world points, correspondences between the first two frames are identified. With these correspondences, the essential matrix between the two frames is computed, and the associated 2D points are triangulated into 3D points.

For each subsequent frame, correspondences between the 2D points and the 3D world points are found, and the relative transformation is computed using PICP. At each new iteration, it is important to identify points that have not been seen before and add them (after triangulation) to the set of existing world points. A total of 490 world points were found.

PICP performed better when combined with inlier rejection and a threshold of 3000.

After computing the complete robot trajectory, the scale between the ground truth trajectory and the estimated one is determined to facilitate a better comparison.

The estimated trajectory (both scaled and unscaled), the estimated world points, and the rotational and translational errors are provided in the respective output files (located under output/). Corresponding plots are also included.
(I am sorry for the ugly plot for comparing gt and estimated trajectories, but all the nice libraries for plotting data were too much for my old computer)
